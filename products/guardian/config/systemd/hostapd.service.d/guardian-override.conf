# Guardian Override for hostapd.service
# Removes dependency on network-online.target to allow AP startup without WAN
# This enables Guardian to work in offline/disconnected mode
#
# Version: 5.1.0

[Unit]
# Clear the default After= and Wants= that include network-online.target
After=
Wants=

# Our dependencies - start after wlan interface is ready, not after WAN
After=guardian-wlan.service guardian-offline.service local-fs.target
Wants=guardian-wlan.service
Requires=guardian-wlan.service

# Don't block on network-online - we ARE the network for clients
# This is critical for offline-first operation

# Restart automatically if hostapd crashes
Restart=on-failure
RestartSec=5

# Give the service time to start
TimeoutStartSec=30

# Environment for hostapd
