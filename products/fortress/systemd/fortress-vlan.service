# fortress-vlan.service - Fortress OVS Post-Netplan Configuration
#
# This service runs AFTER netplan/systemd-networkd has created:
#   - OVS bridge (FTS)
#   - VLAN interfaces (vlan100, vlan200)
#   - IP addressing
#
# This service only configures what netplan cannot:
#   - OpenFlow rules for traffic flow
#   - Port VLAN tagging (access/trunk modes)
#   - Container network bridge (veth to VLAN 200)
#
# The bridge and VLAN interfaces are created by netplan, which is
# faster and more reliable than bash scripts.
#
# Install:
#   sudo cp fortress-vlan.service /etc/systemd/system/
#   sudo systemctl daemon-reload
#   sudo systemctl enable fortress-vlan.service
#

# No sleep needed - systemd-networkd handles timing via netlink events
# The script waits for bridge to exist (max 15s) if needed

# Run OVS post-setup (brings up VLANs, OpenFlow rules, port VLANs, container veth)
ExecStart=/opt/hookprobe/fortress/devices/common/ovs-post-setup.sh setup

# CRITICAL: Restart dnsmasq after OVS flows are configured
# This ensures DHCP works properly - dnsmasq may have started before
# OpenFlow rules were in place, causing WiFi clients to get 169.254.x.x
# The dash prefix (-) means ignore failures (dnsmasq might not be installed)
ExecStartPost=-/bin/systemctl restart dnsmasq.service

# On stop, don't cleanup (keep config for debugging)
# Use 'systemctl restart fortress-vlan' to reapply
