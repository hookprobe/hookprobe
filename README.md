## 💡 The Vision

> *"In a world where attackers share everything, defenders must too."*

**The security industry is broken.** Enterprise protection costs $50,000/year. Small businesses get ransomed. Individuals are left defenseless. Meanwhile, the bad guys collaborate in forums and marketplaces while the good guys fight alone.

**We're building the resistance.**

HookProbe is a **decentralized security mesh** where every node protects every other node. When a Guardian in Tokyo blocks a zero-day, a Sentinel in São Paulo is protected in seconds. When a Fortress in Berlin identifies ransomware, the entire mesh learns instantly.

**⭐ Star this repo** if you believe security should be accessible to everyone. Stars help others discover protection.

---

## 🚀 Why HookProbe?

| The Problem | Our Answer |
|-------------|------------|
| 💰 Security costs $50K+/year | **$75 hardware, $0 software** |
| 🔒 Black-box algorithms | **Every decision is explainable** |
| 🏢 Enterprise-only protection | **Same AI for everyone** |
| 🤐 Vendors own your data | **Your data never leaves your edge** |
| 😰 Constant manual work | **Set it and forget it** |
| 😔 Fighting alone | **Collective mesh defense** |

---

## The HookProbe Promise

**Transparency creates trust. Trust enables achievement.**

HookProbe is built on a simple belief: security technology should empower people, not create dependency. When you can see exactly how your protection works, audit every line of code, and understand every decision the system makes, you're free to focus on what matters - building, creating, and achieving more.

We reject the security industry's black-box approach. Our code is open. Our algorithms are documented. Our data handling is verifiable. When one HookProbe node anywhere in the world detects a threat, every node learns instantly - without anyone's private data ever leaving their control.

**This is security that works *for* you, not security that works *on* you.**

---

## Why Transparency Matters

| Black-Box Security | HookProbe (Transparent) |
|-------------------|-------------------------|
| "Trust us, we're protecting you" | Audit the code yourself |
| Your data sent to vendor clouds | Your data never leaves your edge |
| Opaque threat scoring | See exactly why decisions are made |
| Vendor lock-in | Open standards, your choice |
| Security creates dependency | Security enables independence |
| Complex interfaces hide complexity | Simple interfaces, documented complexity |

**The difference:** Black boxes ask for trust. Transparency earns it.

---

## How HookProbe Helps You Achieve More

### 1. Reclaim Your Time

Traditional security demands constant attention - alerts to investigate, logs to review, updates to manage. HookProbe handles this automatically so you can focus on your actual work.

- **Automated threat response** - No manual investigation needed
- **Self-learning baselines** - Adapts to your environment
- **Collective intelligence** - Benefits from global threat detection without effort

### 2. Protect Without Complexity

Enterprise security typically requires dedicated teams. HookProbe brings the same protection to anyone, regardless of technical background.

```bash
# That's it. You're protected.
./install.sh --tier guardian
```

### 3. Scale Without Cost

From a single Raspberry Pi to a global mesh of thousands of nodes - same technology, same transparency, scaling to your needs.

| Your Situation | Solution | Investment |
|----------------|----------|------------|
| Home network | Guardian | $75 hardware, $0 software |
| Small business | Fortress | $200 hardware, $0 software |
| Growing company | Nexus | $2000 hardware, $0 software |

### 4. Own Your Security Data

Every security decision, every threat detection, every response action - it's all yours. Export it. Analyze it. Verify it. No vendor has access unless you grant it.

---

## The Collective Defense Mesh

HookProbe's most powerful feature isn't code - it's community.

```
Node A (Singapore)     Detects zero-day attack
        │
        ▼
Mesh Intelligence      Validates pattern, creates signature
        │
        ├──────────────────────────────────────┐
        ▼                                      ▼
Node B (London)        Node C (New York)       Node D (Berlin)
Protected in <30s      Protected in <30s        Protected in <30s
```

**How it works:**
1. **Detection** - Any node detects a new threat pattern
2. **Validation** - Mesh consensus confirms it's legitimate
3. **Distribution** - Anonymized signature shared instantly
4. **Protection** - All nodes block the threat

**What we never share:**
- Your raw traffic data
- Your IP addresses
- Your internal network details
- Any personally identifiable information

**What we share:**
- Anonymized threat signatures
- Attack patterns (source removed)
- Model weight updates (federated learning)

This is collective defense that respects individual privacy.

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Stack Components

| Component | Purpose | Innovation |
|-----------|---------|------------|
| **HTP** | HookProbe Transport Protocol | Post-quantum Kyber KEM, keyless authentication |
| **DSM** | Decentralized Security Mesh | Byzantine fault-tolerant consensus, 2/3 quorum |
| **NEURO** | Neural Resonance Protocol | Device fingerprinting via weight evolution |
| **QSECBIT** | Quantified Security Metric | Real-time RAG scoring (GREEN/AMBER/RED) |
| **NSE** | Neural Synaptic Encryption | Keys emerge from neural state - nobody knows the password |

### The NSE Innovation

Traditional encryption requires sharing secrets. NSE eliminates this:

```
Traditional: "Do you know the password?"
NSE:         "Can your neural state produce the matching key?"

Keys are DERIVED from:
├── Neural weight state (unique per device)
├── Resonance Drift Vector (temporal)
├── Qsecbit score (security context)
└── Collective entropy (mesh participation)

Result: Encryption where nobody knows the key
```

### E2E Security Flow

When an attack is detected, the entire stack activates:

```
1. DETECTION   → Qsecbit identifies threat (L2-L7)
2. SCORING     → RAG status calculated (GREEN/AMBER/RED)
3. RESPONSE    → XDP/eBPF blocks at kernel level
4. PROPAGATION → Mesh consciousness spreads intelligence
5. CONSENSUS   → DSM validates across validator network
6. PROTECTION  → All nodes protected in <30 seconds
```

### Adversarial Security Testing

HookProbe includes AI vs AI testing - our Red Team AI attacks the stack while our Blue Team AI defends:

- **9 Attack Vectors**: TER replay, timing, entropy poisoning, weight prediction, etc.
- **CVSS Scoring**: Vulnerability severity from 0.0-10.0
- **Automated Mitigations**: AI-suggested code-level fixes
- **Designer Alerts**: Multi-channel notifications for critical findings

> "Know your vulnerabilities before someone else does"

---

## Technical Foundation (Fully Documented)

Every component is documented. Every algorithm is explained. Nothing is hidden.

### Qsecbit Engine - Transparent Threat Scoring

Traditional security: "This is bad" (trust us)
HookProbe: "This scores 0.72 because drift=0.25, attack_probability=0.85, decay=0.12"

```python
# The actual formula - no secrets
Qsecbit = α·drift + β·p_attack + γ·decay + δ·q_drift + ε·energy_anomaly

# You can verify every calculation
# See: core/qsecbit/qsecbit.py
```

| Protection | Status | What It Means |
|------------|--------|---------------|
| > 55% | 🟢 GREEN | All clear · Protected |
| 30-55% | 🟡 AMBER | Monitoring · Stay alert |
| < 30% | 🔴 RED | Under attack · Defending |

### dnsXai - Explainable DNS Protection

Not just "blocked" - but *why* it was blocked:

```
Domain: suspicious-tracker.com
Decision: BLOCKED
Confidence: 92%
Reason: High entropy (4.2), matches tracking pattern, CNAME resolves to known tracker
Category: ADVERTISING_TRACKER
```

Every block is explainable. Every decision is auditable.

### HTP Protocol - Verifiable Security

Post-quantum cryptography you can inspect:
- **Kyber KEM** - NIST-approved, implementation viewable
- **ChaCha20-Poly1305** - Standard authenticated encryption
- **Entropy-based authentication** - Novel but documented

### XDP/eBPF - Kernel-Level, User-Auditable

DDoS mitigation at the kernel level, but you can see exactly what rules are applied:

```bash
# View active XDP rules
./hookprobe-ctl xdp show

# Understand every decision
./hookprobe-ctl xdp explain --ip 192.168.1.100
```
