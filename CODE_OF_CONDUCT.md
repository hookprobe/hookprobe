All complaints will be reviewed and investigated **promptly and fairly**.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the **privacy and security** of the reporter.

### What to Include in a Report

## Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these guidelines in determining consequences:

### 1. Correction

**Community Impact:** Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional.

**Consequence:** A private, written warning providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

### 2. Warning

**Community Impact:** A violation through a single incident or series of actions.

**Consequence:** A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved for a specified period. This includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.

### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact:** A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence:** A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period. No public or private interaction with the people involved is allowed during this period. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

### 4. Permanent Ban

**Consequence:** A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the community.

## Special Considerations for Security Researchers

Given HookProbe's focus on security, we recognize that:

- **Vulnerability discussion** must follow responsible disclosure
- **Security testing** should be authorized and documented
- **Exploit code** should never be shared publicly without coordination
- **Ethical hacking** is encouraged within proper bounds

See [SECURITY.md](docs/SECURITY.md) for vulnerability reporting procedures.

---

## Creating Inclusive Documentation

As contributors, we commit to making our documentation inclusive:

- Use **plain language** where possible
- Provide **examples for beginners**
- Avoid **jargon without explanation**
- Consider **non-native English speakers**
- Make content **accessible** (alt text, proper formatting)

---

## Conflict Resolution

Before escalating to enforcement:

1. **Assume good intent** - Misunderstandings happen
2. **Talk directly** - Many issues resolve through conversation
3. **Seek mediation** - Ask a maintainer to help facilitate
4. **Take a break** - Step away if emotions are high

We're all here because we believe in HookProbe's mission. Let's work together.
